# Enable Barcodes and QR codes



In order to be able to add custom barcodes and QR codes to *Objects*, an *Instance
Admin* needs to add the $BARCODE property to the object type for which
barcodes/QR codes are needed.

 

The barcode functionality is disabled by default in the ELN UI. This can
be enabled by a *lab manager* or a *group admin* with admin rights to
edit the **Settings**, as shown below.

After enabling the option, please refresh your browser. The **Barcodes/QR Codes Generator** will be shown in the menu under **Utilities**, in the **Tools** tab and a
barcode icon will be added on the top bar, next to the search box (see below).

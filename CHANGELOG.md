## Version 20.10.0 RC (Release Candidate) (27 October 2020)
- New features and Major Changes compared to release 19.06
- Extensions to the data model:
- Date Data Type: Intended to be use when timestamps are not needed.
- Sample Property Type: Allows to link Samples without using the Parent/Children relationships.
- Sample Relationship Properties: Allows to add information to relationship connections.
- Changes to the data model:
- The Internally Managed and Internal Namespace concepts for properties have been merged. Now there is only Internally managed. Only the SYSTEM user can modify these.
- Search engine: Completely rewritten to be faster, scale better and lower memory consumption. Queries will now behave like classic database queries instead of fuzzy full text search queries.

### Admin UI Currently a preview, will replace the Core UI on the future.

### ELN-LIMS UI
- Improved plugin system for the UI.
- Microscopy and Flow Cytometry UI are now ELN plugins.
- Mayor Technology Upgrades, now using:
  - Java 11
  - Postgres 11
  - Bioformats 6.5.1
  - Jetty 9.4.30
  - and other many upgrades.
  - and lots, lots, lots of bug fixes.
- For more details see sprint change log between S301 and S334.

## Deprecated
As a rule of a thumb, deprecated features should stop being used since they can be removed in future releases.
- Material entity type is deprecated: Sample Property Types can be used instead for the same use cases.
- File Type is deprecated.
- Managed Properties are deprecated.
- Core UI is deprecated. For admin tasks use the new Admin UI.
- V1 API: A reminder that all new developments should be done using the V3 API, V1 even if still kept for backwards compatibility with old plugins is not developed anymore.
- GeneralInformationService
- GeneralInformationChangingService

### V3 API
- isInternalNamesSpace & setInternalNameSpace : Now manage the same flag "Internally Managed"
- FetchOptions.cacheMode : The new search engine ignores this, always getting the results from the database.
- EntityWithPropertiesSortOptions.fetchedFieldsScore : The new search engine ignores this, only full text search has a weights system to sort results, non usable on standard queries.
- AbstractEntitySearchCriteria.withProperty : deprecated in favour of using withXXXProperty, XXX being String, Date, Boolean or Number, check Javadoc for more details.
- AbstractEntitySearchCriteria.withAnyProperty : deprecated in favour of using withAnyXXXProperty, XXX being String, Date, Boolean or Number, check Javadoc for more details.
- Hot-deployed (aka "predeployed") Java plugins (i.e. entity validation plugin, dynamic property plugin, managed property plugin) are deprecated. WARNING: using them may lead to a deadlock during the Application Server startup.

## Removed
- The technologies for proteomics and screening where deprecated on 19.06 not been provided by the installer. Now they are finally removed and openBIS instances with these technologies CAN'T be upgraded. The upgrade procedure will detect their presence and prevent the upgrade.
